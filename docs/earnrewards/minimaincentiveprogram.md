# Incentive Program

:::info THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS NOW CLOSED
The Incentive Rewards Program is now closed to new users.

Existing users will continue to earn, however all Rewards due for 2023 will be received in March (prior to Token distribution) instead of daily.

From Mainnet version 1.0 and above, you do not need to have your Incentive ID connected to your node.
 
As long as have completed and passed the Proof of Person verification process, you will be able to claim your Total Rewards balance to a Mainnet node of your choice (including Rewards for Jan 1st until TGE) once the Payout process begins.

Please refer to the [Testnet Status](/docs/runanode/testnetstatus/) page for the latest information.
:::

## What is the Minima Incentive Program?
The Incentive Program is designed to reward you for installing and running a Minima node.
You will receive one Reward every day your node pings us to let us know it is connected.

## How do I get involved?
The Incentive Reward Program is now closed to new users, however you can still [run a node](/docs/runanode/get_started) to use the Minima blockchain and decentralized applications.

## How many Rewards can I earn?
You will earn 1 x Minima reward each day. 
:::note from january 2023
From January 2023, Rewards will no longer be paid daily. Instead, all Rewards for 2023 will be paid in March before Token distribution, provided you continue to run your node.
:::
<!-- You will earn 1 x Minima reward each day. These rewards will be added to your balance daily. You can also earn rewards by finding bugs as a tester, participating in one of the test cycles. Let one of the team know in Discord if this is of interest. -->

## Why is Minima offering this?
As we test and improve Minima ahead of our Mainnet launch, your participation is precious to us. Together, we can collaboratively:

- Grow the Minima network
- Test how different devices operate
- Find or fix bugs on the Minima Testnet
- Perfect the Minima application and protocol for Mainnet launch
- Help grow the Minima community membership and participation

## What equipment do I need?
To participate, you will need an Android mobile (9.0 or above), PC, Mac or Linux. Minima currently doesnâ€™t run on iPhone/iOS, but this is on the future roadmap.

## Can anyone run a node and join the Incentive Program?
Yes, providing you have the correct device to install and run a MInima node.

## How many nodes can I connect to my Incentive Reward account?

You are no longer required to connect your Incentive ID to your node.  

## How many Incentive Reward accounts can I have?

One Incentive Reward account per person.

## Will there be any updates?
In the run-up to Mainnet, there will likely be several upgrades to the system. These are known as 'hard forks'. Any earned Minima rewards will temporarily be removed when these happen, and we will reinstate the exact amount after the update. Any Minima tokens created via the wallet on the testnet will also be lost during a hard fork.

## When will I get my rewards?
Everyone in the Incentive Program will get their rewards at the Token Generation Event (TGE). This is scheduled to be in Q1 2023. 

## How do I report a bug?
