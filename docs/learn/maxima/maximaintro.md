# About

## What is Maxima?

**Every Minima node includes Maxima.**

Maxima is to information what Minima is to value.

Where Minima provides freedom of *value* exchange; Maxima provides freedom of *information* exchange.

Maxima is an information transport layer protocol that allows anyone to exchange information, with their chosen contacts, over Minima’s peer-to-peer network.

This unlocks the power of composability to create true Web 3 applications combining peer-to-peer exchange of value and information. 

Totally decentralized - without censorship - without personal data collection.

---------

**Each Minima node runs the Minima blockchain** in full to enable all nodes to transact with each other without third-party intermediaries. 

Transacting over Minima involves sending coins, custom tokens or NFTs between nodes. Transactions can be simple payments or programmed to cater for more complex use cases using Minima’s smart-contract language, KISS.

When sending transactions over the network, users must perform a small amount of work from their device, called **Transaction Proof of Work (TxPoW), which secures the network from attack.**

---------

**Each Minima node also runs the Maxima protocol** to enable nodes to send encrypted data like text, pictures or documents to each other, independently of the Minima blockchain. 

Users can communicate with a peer on the network e.g. a friend, family member or another device, by adding them as a **Maxima Contact**. Messages can then be sent to Maxima Contacts via decentralized apps (known as MiniDapps) such as MaxSolo or Chatter which interact with the Maxima protocol.
 
Although users can send messages over Maxima free of charge, to prevent spam, they must contribute to the security of the Minima network by performing a small Tx-PoW when sending a message. On average, the TxPoW required to send a message amounts to 1 second of work.

## How does it work?

Each node on the Minima peer to peer network not only has a wallet address for receiving funds but also a contact address to receive messages/data over Maxima.

A user's Maxima contact address is an extension of their Minima wallet address and includes their "location" in the peer to peer network - essentially an IP address where they can be reached. 

This allows people to add their friends/family/connections as contacts and send encrypted messages back and forth to each other.

Maxima manages the connections between contacts to ensure users remain connected and has in-built privacy features, for example dynamic contact addresses. 

If you no longer want to be contactable by one of your contacts, you can delete them from your contacts list and you will automatically be removed from their list. Further still, they will no longer be able to locate you in the network unless you provide them with your updated Maxima contact address.

Similar to Minima, where each user must provide a small amount of computational power to the chain by "mining" their transaction; on Maxima, each user must also "mine" their messages before they can be sent to a contact. 

Hence, Maxima is a source of additional hashrate securing the Minima blockchain. -->
