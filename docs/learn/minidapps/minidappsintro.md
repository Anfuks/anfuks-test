# About

## Overview

We are excited to announce the highly anticipated release of our new MiniDapp System! 

Before you get stuck in, here is an introduction to the MiniDapp System and explanation of what MiniDapps are.

## What is the MiniDapp System?
The MiniDapp system is an open application ecosystem.<br/>
Similar to the Operating System on your phone that enables you to use Android apps, the MiniDapp System enables you to use MiniDapps on your Minima node.

## What are MiniDapps?
MiniDapps are Minima’s **Decentralized Applications** running over Minima’s blockchain network. In other words, applications built using the functionality enabled by the Minima blockchain and peer-to-peer network. This also includes our Information Layer - Maxima and, in future, our Layer 2 - Omnia. <br/>
They are your gateway to a true Web 3 economy, open and free.

A MiniDapp can be created for almost anything - some examples include decentralized finance, games, voting, marketplaces, messaging, social media - the world is your oyster.      

## How do MiniDapps differ from other decentralized applications (dApps)?
Other ‘decentralized’ applications are decentralized in name only, often relying on centralized services to run effectively. MiniDapps are not. MiniDapps are installed on and run directly from your node, and because every Minima user runs a complete node, there is no need to rely on centralized websites or companies to use MiniDapps. They are permissionless and borderless.


## What MiniDapps are currently available?
You will find some MiniDapps, developed by the Minima Team, available to download our [GitHub](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/tree/master/mds/store/files). 
In future, we expect the majority of MiniDapps to be built by the open-source community—that could be you!

A brief description of each of them is below.

### 1. News Feed
The News Feed is a simple MiniDapp where you can find all our latest blog posts and community updates. 

### 2. The Wallet 
The Wallet is where you can manage all the funds you own on the Minima blockchain.<br/>
DO NOT SEND FUNDS FROM OTHER CHAINS TO YOUR MINIMA ADDRESS, YOUR FUNDS WILL BE LOST.

**Using the Wallet MiniDapp, you can:**
- Check the balance of your Minima or any other Custom Tokens or NFTs you own 
- Create your own Custom Tokens and NFTs. Enter a URL ending in .jpg, .jpeg or .png to give your tokens an image
- Share your Minima address with others for receiving $MINIMA, Custom Tokens or NFTs created on the Minima blockchain
- Send $MINIMA, Custom Tokens or NFTs created on the Minima blockchain to other Minima addresses
- Check the Status of your Minima node

### 3. Block Explorer
The Block Explorer lets you view the latest blocks and transactions on the Minima blockchain.

**Using the Block Explorer MiniDapp, you can:**
- Navigate through the Minima blockchain
- Search by address or TxPoW ID - due to the pruning of the chain, only the last 1000 blocks will be visible
- Select a block to view its details and the transactions in it

**Additional information**
- Each block in the chain consists of a main transaction and a transaction list. 
- When you select a block, you will see 3 tabs, Details, Inputs and Outputs. 
**Details:** shows the block details, including its transaction list at the bottom.
**Inputs:** shows details for the coins used as inputs to the block’s main transaction (if one exists). 
**Outputs:** shows the corresponding Outputs of the main transaction (if one exists).

### 4. MaxSolo

MaxSolo is an encrypted, peer-to-peer messaging application, which uses Minima’s information transfer layer, Maxima. Learn more about Maxima below.
	
**Using MaxSolo you can:**
- Send your Maxima Contacts messages, images and $MINIMA coins or Custom Tokens/NFTs created on Minima 
- Experience freedom of information

**Additional information**
To use MaxSolo, you must add your Maxima Contacts on the Contacts page.<br/>
Click [here](/docs/learn/maxima/maximaintro) to learn more about Maxima.

For instructions on how to set up your Maxima Contacts, please see the [Run a Node](/docs/runanode/get_started_in_3_steps) section, selecting your platform of choice.

### 5. Incentive Program
The Incentive Program MiniDapp is where you can check your Rewards balance for participating in the Incentive Program.
 
**Using the Incentive Program MiniDapp, you can:**
- Login to your Incentive Program account
- Check your Reward Balance and last ping time
- Copy your Incentive Program ID 
- Share your Incentive Program Invite Link to gain extra Rewards for inviting others

### 6. Script IDE
Script IDE is an Integrated Development Environment for developers to easily write and test Minima scripts.

**Using Script IDE, you can:**
- Write, Clean and Save Minima scripts
- Test Minima scripts by running them to determine their result and script address

**Additional Information**
Script IDE is best used on your Desktop interface. Minima scripts are written in Minima’s KISS scripting language. Learn more by following the Transaction Tutorial in the Docs MiniDapp.

### 7. Terminal
The Terminal MiniDapp is a developer app used to execute Minima commands directly on your node without a user interface. 

**Using the Terminal MiniDapp, you can:**
- Check the Status of your node and the blockchain
- Set and check your Incentive Program Account (during Testnet only)
- Manually construct and post transactions
- Create and run Minima scripts
- Install and uninstall MiniDapps

**Additional Information**
Type **help** in the Terminal to see a list of all the commands. 

### 8. Docs
The Docs MiniDapp is where you can learn about the Minima Protocol. <br/>
Here you will find our documentation and developer tutorial, which introduces Minima’s KISS scripting language for creating smart contracts on Minima.


## How do I use MiniDapps?
For help using MiniDapps, please see the [Run a Node](/docs/runanode/get_started_in_3_steps) section and select your platform of choice.

## Who can build a MiniDapp?
Anyone can learn to build a MiniDapp. <br/>
The front-end for MiniDapps can be written using the widely known JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Minima’s KISS scripting language is Turing-Complete, allowing for powerful smart contract driven applications. Building a MiniDapp is accessible to anyone willing to learn! 

To learn more about Minima’s scripting language, check out the [scripting](/docs/learn/minima/scripting) section and follow the Transaction Tutorial found in the Docs MiniDapp.<br/>

Additional Developer materials will be available soon!
