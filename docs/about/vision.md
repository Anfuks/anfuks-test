# Our Vision

Minima is an ultra-lean blockchain protocol designed to run on mobile and IoT devices, enabling every user to operate a full constructing and validating node. 

This approach ensures a completely decentralized network that is scalable, inclusive, secure, and censorship-resistant. 

Minima maximizes blockchain benefits while minimizing vulnerabilities, making it a self-sustained and complete ecosystem.

### Inclusive and Accessible
Minima's small file size allows it to run on mobile and IoT devices, making it accessible to a wide range of users. 

This accessibility opens up numerous potential use cases that are only acheivable when a user is able to a full node themselves. 

### Censorship-resistant
Censorship-resistance is where the value of blockchain technology lies, and only comes with complete decentralization.

Minima's complete constructing and validating nodes - without fee-incentivized, centralized miners - create a network owned, run, and secured by its users. 

This level of true decentralization ensures autonomy and accountability, offering robust resistance to censorship.

### Secure and Scalable
Minima is designed to be quantum-resistant, and its adaptive block sizes and off-chain transactions contribute to its scalability and network security.

### Benefits for Developers and Enterprises
For developers, Minima provides an accessible coding platform using a simple web-native language (Javascript, CSS & HTML5). It allows them to build decentralized applications across various use cases, tapping into a growing number of users.

For enterprises, Minima offers a stable and scalable platform to build next-generation applications that reduce costs, enhance efficiency, engage customers more effectively, combat fraud, and mitigate risks. 

The absence of the requirement for chain governance de-risks the development process, creating a more efficient and transparent ecosystem for all stakeholders.

## Total decentralization
True censorship-resistance on a blockchain is not achievable without true decentralization. By re-engineering the blockchain, Minima has created a more resilient protocol, with no central points of failure, where all participants collaborate as equals, removing the need for on-chain governance, or for rewarding miners to secure the chain. This level of true decentralization creates a highly resilient ecosystem, that allows individuals and enterprises to operate, experiment and innovate in a secure and scalable environment.

## A better protocol for everyone
Minima streamlines and democratises the transfer of value and information to create an ecosystem that has true value for users, developers and enterprises alike. For users, the Minima ecosystem is completely inclusive and accessible, allowing anyone with a mobile phone to run a complete node and be part of a community that adds value and utility for all. For developers, Minima provides a coding platform that is accessible and easy to build upon, using a simple web-native coding language (Javascript & HTML5). Allowing developers to build decentralized applications for a growing number of users across a vast range of potential use cases. For enterprises, Minima provides a resilient, scalable platform on which they can build the next generation of applications that will reduce costs, increase efficiency, lower barriers to customer engagement, reduce fraud and mitigate against risk.
