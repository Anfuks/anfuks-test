## About KYC

### Why do I have to do KYC?

It is a legal requirement of FINMA as part of the anti-money laundering and terror financing prevention regulations to check the identity of every participant. We will not use this data or share it with anyone.

Our SRO (self regulatory organisation external representative) in Switzerland will store the data for one year to conform with FINMA KYC/AML. We will keep your email address in our database to send you notifications throughout the Presale.

### Which countries cannot participate?

- Afghanistan
- Belarus
- Cuba
- Iran
- Iraq
- Libya
- Myanmar
- North Korea
- Russia
- Syria
- USA
- Venezuela
- Yemen

As well as all other countries on the OFAC list.


### How do I complete KYC?

Depending on how much you are looking to purchase in $USDT, you will need to provide the following:

1. Proof of ID (national ID card, passport, or driving license)
2. Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, rent agreement, or tax bill)
3. Face verification (take or upload a photo)
4. Proof/source of funds wallet address

As well as any other requirement as per FINMA regulations at the time of purchase.

### Who is in charge of KYC?

Minima is using a third-party provider for this process. KYC is a legal and regulatory requirement of FINMA, to check the identity of every participant. We will not use this data or share it with anyone.

### How much KYC do I need to provide depending on how much I purchase?

As follows:

#### 50-999.99 $USDT

Information needed:

- Full Name (Surname, Given names)
- Full residential address (including country)
- Nationality
- Date of birth
- Place of birth / origin
- Gender

Documents needed:

- Valid Passport or National Identification Card (including back side)
- Selfie with Passport / ID in hand or face recognition

#### 1,000 – 9,999.99 $USDT

Information needed:

- Full Name (Surname, Given names)

#### 10,000 $USDT or more

### How long does KYC take?

You could be approved immediately, sent for manual checking, or rejected. If you're sent for manual checking, there is no set time limit on how long this takes as it depends on many factors - including how many other applications are being reviewed. Please be patient and keep checking your email.

### I have been rejected, what can I do?

Unfortunately this means you cannot take part in this stage of the presale. You can try in a later tranche, using a different email address perhaps - but rejections are usually due to submitted documentation, so the issue was probably to do with that.

### What if I miss out on a tranche due to being in review?

Unfortunately, as we can't predict how long KYC will take for each person, this is a risk. There's nothing we can do about it other than advise that you start the process as soon as possible to ensure you don't miss out - and, to ensure that your ID documents are ready. Please see the FAQ for more detail.

### Why is my country not in the dropdown list?

Only the countries that can participate will be shown on the dropdown list. If your country isn't there, you cannot continue. Again, this is something set by the regulators rather than Minima. There is nothing we can override or make an exception so please do not open a support ticket about it.

### Still need help?
