### How do I set up Metamask and complete the transaction?

Follow the instructions here: https://metamask.io/ - make sure you're only using this website as there are scam versions around.

2. Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, rent agreement, or tax bill)
3. Face verification (take or upload a photo)
4. Proof/source of funds wallet address

As well as any other requirement as per FINMA regulations at the time of purchase.

### Who is in charge of KYC?

Minima is using a third-party provider for this process. KYC is a legal and regulatory requirement of FINMA, to check the identity of every participant. We will not use this data or share it with anyone.

### How much KYC do I need to provide?

#### 50-999.99 $USDT

Information needed:

- Full Name (Surname, Given names)
- Full residential address (including country)
- Nationality
- Date of birth
- Place of birth / origin

### How long does KYC take?

You could be approved immediately, sent for manual checking, or rejected. If you're sent for manual checking, there is no set time limit on how long this takes as it depends on many factors - including how many other applications are being reviewed. Please be patient and keep checking your email.

### I have been rejected, what can I do?

Unfortunately this means you cannot take part in this stage of the presale. You can try in a later tranche, using a different email address perhaps - but rejections are usually due to submitted documentation, so the issue was probably to do with that.

### What if I miss out on a tranche due to being in review?

Unfortunately, as we can't predict how long KYC will take for each person, this is a risk. There's nothing we can do about it other than advise that you start the process as soon as possible to ensure you don't miss out - and, to ensure that your ID documents are ready. Please see the FAQ for more detail. -->
