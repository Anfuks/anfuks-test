## What you need to know about… 

### ...Mainnet Bootstrap Phase

The Bootstrap phase for Mainnet has started. This involves gradually moving all node runners to Mainnet from Testnet. 

:::info Checking your version
To check the version of Minima you are running, you can run the `status` command on your node.

**Mainnet:** v1.0.6 or above <br/> 
**Testnet:** v0.103.30 or below 

For help , select your platform of choice from [Get Started](/docs/runanode/get_started) and see the section "How to check the Status of your node".
:::

Mainnet is a hardfork and therefore Testnet (0.103 and below) and Mainnet versions (1.0 and above) are not compatible. This means that once updated you will no longer see any of your Testnet wallet balances and will not be able to restore a Testnet backup to a node on Mainnet. 

You will also have a different Seed Phrase on Mainnet to your Testnet node.

Mainnet Version 1.0 (or above) is now available for:

- Server users
- Docker users
- Manual node runners (on Desktop)
- Android users (from 1st Feb 2023)

If you have installed Minima from the Google Play store, you can set your app to update automatically from the Play Store settings, otherwise check the Play store to Update manually.

Mainnet is a hard fork and not compatible with Testnet, you will no longer see any wallet balances that you saw during Testnet, your wallet balance will be 0.

What you need to do:
- If running Minima on a server, ensure your node is secured! For example, your RPC port must be closed (default port 9005). Information about Port configuration can be found in [System Requirements](/docs/runanode/systemrequirements).
- Take note of your NEW seed phrase which can be found using the `vault` command (Vault page in the app)
- Regularly check the `status` of your node to ensure your tip block is up to date (Health page in the app)
- Android users, please take the time to get familiar with the new app, if you have questions please check the **Help** in the app for more information.


### ...the Incentive Program
The Incentive Rewards Program is now **closed to new members.**

Existing members will continue to earn once on Mainnet at 1 Reward a day, however, you will **no longer see pings after 31st December** being updated on your node.

From Mainnet version 1.0 and above, you **do not need to have your Incentive ID connected to your node.** As long as you have passed the Verify process, you will be able to claim your Total Rewards balance plus Rewards for Jan 1st until TGE. 

All Rewards due for 2023 will be sent to your Incentive Program account in one go (instead of daily) prior to the coin distribution, provided you have passed the Proof of Person verification process.

### ...receiving your Rewards

If you pass the [Proof of Person verification](#incentive-reward-account-verification), you will be able to Request withdrawal of your Rewards to your node when coin distribution begins, currently scheduled for March 2023.

Your Total Rewards available to withdraw will be your existing balance as shown in your account, plus any previously missed rewards, plus all Rewards from January 1st to TGE. 

Once you have requested to withdraw your Incentive Rewards, they will be converted to real Minima and sent to your Minima wallet address.

:::info proof of person
Know Your Customer (KYC) will not be required to collect your Minima Rewards, however, you will be required to complete our ‘Proof of Person’ Verify process so we can ensure that you are not a bot!
:::

### ...Incentive Reward Account Verification

Minima operates a “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy. This means that a real human must exist behind each Incentive Reward Account.

In order to ensure that your account is genuine and not the product of bot activity, we require each Incentive Reward Account holder to pass our simple Verify process.

#### What is the Verify process?

Our Verify process consists of two phases:

**Phase 1**

Our team will review the Incentive Reward database algorithmically and manually to identify accounts that are either <br/>
a) clearly the result of bot activity or <br/> b) part of a network of accounts.

Accounts that fail Phase 1 will not be notified.

**Phase 2**

All accounts that pass Phase 1 will be invited via the email address on your Incentive Reward Account to complete Phase 2.

Phase 2 started on the 13th January.

This email contains a unique link for you to click that will identify your account to us. You will then be asked to complete a form that will provide us with the verification we need to satisfy our “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy.

Please take note that your link is single-use, so **please do not click it until you are ready to proceed with verification.**

If you have successfully verified, you will receive email confirmation within 24 hours. 

Once you have your confirmation, you are guaranteed to receive your rewards at Token Distribution, pending collection of your Wallet details at a later date.

#### It has been 24 hours since completing Verify, but I have not received a confirmation email
