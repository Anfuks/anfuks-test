## What you need to know about… 

### ...Moving your node to Mainnet

If you were running a node during our Testnet, you will need to uninstall your node and start a node on Mainnet. 

:::info Checking your version
To check the version of Minima you are running, you can run the `status` command on your node.

**Mainnet:** v1.0.6 or above <br/> 
**Testnet:** v0.103.30 or below 

For help , select your platform of choice from [Get Started](/docs/runanode/get_started) and see the section "How to check the Status of your node".
:::

Mainnet is a hardfork and therefore Testnet (0.103 and below) and Mainnet versions (1.0 and above) are not compatible. This means that once updated you will **no longer see any of your Testnet wallet balances and will not be able to restore a Testnet backup to a node on Mainnet.** 

**You will also have a different Seed Phrase on Mainnet to your Testnet node.**

Please visit the [Get Started](/docs/runanode/get_started) page to set up a node on Mainnet. 

:::warning
Please see [Securing your node](/docs/runanode/securefunds) before using your node for the first time.

### ...the Incentive Program

For details on how to withdraw your Rewards earned during Testnet, please see the [Incentive Program](/docs/earnrewards/minimaincentiveprogram#how-to-collect-your-incentive-program-rewards) page.

#### Incentive Program Account Verification

Minima operates a “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy. This means that a real human must exist behind each Incentive Reward Account.

To ensure your account is not the product of bot activity, we require each Incentive Reward Account holder to pass our simple Verify process.

You can check whether you have successfully verified by entering the email you used to sign up [here](https://verify.minima.global/results).

#### What is the Verify process?

Our Verify process consists of two phases:

**Phase 1**

Our team will review the Incentive Reward database algorithmically and manually to identify accounts that are either clearly the result of bot activity or part of a network of accounts.

Accounts that fail Phase 1 will not be notified.

**Phase 2** (from 13th January 2023)

All accounts that pass Phase 1 will be invited via the email address on your Incentive Reward Account to complete Phase 2.

This email contains a unique link for you to click that will identify your account to us. You will then be asked to complete a form that will provide us with the verification we need to satisfy our “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy.

Please take note that your link is single-use, so **please do not click it until you are ready to proceed with verification.**<br/>
If you have successfully verified, you will receive email confirmation within 24 hours. 

Once you have your confirmation, you can [withdraw your rewards.](/docs/earnrewards/minimaincentiveprogram)

#### It has been 24 hours since completing Verify, but I have not received a confirmation email

You have failed Verification. If you believe this to be in error, you can contact us at querysupport@minima.global.

One of the team can look into why you failed and you might be contacted via a support ticket on Discord, however there is no guarantee of verification. Any decision made is final.
