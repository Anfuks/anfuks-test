# Welcome

Welcome aboard — your journey starts here!

This post will provide you with a high-level overview of our **purpose**, the **values** that align us, and what we’re **collectively working towards.**

We hope this will make you feel at home in our community, and act as a springboard for further exploration.


## What is our purpose?

Minima was born out of the desire to build a network that **empowers freedom for all.** 

We believe everyone should have **equal opportunity** to **create**, **communicate** and **collaborate** —  so we cooperate within our network to achieve this goal.

## What are our values?

Our values are our moral compass that guide how we interact with others in our community. If you share these same values, you’re already a Minimalist. 

**Collaboration:** Minima is about collaboration, not competition. What is good for you is good for me. Working together and being transparent with each other is a fundamental part of what makes Minima tick.

**Participation:** Like the protocol, we will only succeed if everyone is an active participant. Put the work in, and you will be rewarded.

**Empowerment:** We are working for freedom, and so we give everyone the freedom they need to thrive. No matter who you are. 

**Accountability:** With empowerment comes accountability. We trust each other to take responsibility when things go wrong, making sure that we first attempt to resolve any issues ourselves.

We’re building a future where everyone can freely connect and prosper — [join us](https://linktr.ee/minima_global?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=f5b69262-8b95-4bc2-abc9-abf28ce9f92b). 


## What are we working towards?

For every mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) device to run a Minima node - creating **a truly decentralized network** that **no one controls and everyone owns** - where value can be exchanged without third parties, apps can be built without restrictions and people can connect without limits. 

Freedom is possible and together we can achieve it.
