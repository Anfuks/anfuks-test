# Our Tokenomics

## Allocation Overview

Minima has a hard-capped supply of 1 billion coins, that will slowly reduce over time as a result of [The Burn](/docs/learn/minima/coreconcepts#the-burn). 

All coins will be minted at the Token Generation Event and allocated into the following categories: 

![Minima](/img/token/tokenDistributionCharts1Lm.svg#gh-light-mode-only)![Minima](/img/token/tokenDistributionCharts1Dm.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

Allocation categories are discussed in more detail [below](#allocation-categories). 

First, an overview of the total circulating supply of Minima coins, followed by an outline of how coins will be split between Native Minima ($MINIMA) and Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA) after the Token Generation Event. 

## Total Circulating Supply

Circulating supply measures how many coins are unlocked from the total supply over time. The number of coins released from a particular allocation category at any given time is determined by the release schedule for each allocation category, specified in the [Release Schedule](#release-schedule) section of this paper. 

The majority of Minima’s supply is subject to long-term lock-ups to slowly ease liquidity into the market. All supplies issued at the Token Generation Event will be unlocked after 39 months.

The chart below shows how Minima’s total circulating supply will gradually release coins into the total supply in time. The horizontal line at the top of the chart represents Minima's hard-capped supply of 1 billion coins. However, the chart ignores how [The Burn](/docs/learn/minima/coreconcepts#the-burn) will slowly reduce Minima’s total supply over time. 

All charts included in this paper begin on the month of the Token Generation Event, March 2023.

In addition, the following table shows Minima’s total circulating supply at key milestones:

| | Token Generation Event | 1st   anniversary  | 2nd anniversary  |3rd   anniversary  |39 months  |
|:------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
|**Circulating Supply** | 217,127,000 |647,137,692 |850,281,538 |965,795,385 |1,000,000,000 |
|**Total Supply** |  1,000,000,000 |1,000,000,000 |1,000,000,000 |1,000,000,000 |1,000,000,000 |

### Circulating Supply at TGE

The exchange tradable liquidity of Minima coins will only be via Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA) at the Token Generation Event (TGE). 

Prior to launching Native Minima on exchanges in Q3/Q4 2023, Native Minima ($MINIMA) will be tradable peer-2-peer for ETH or any ERC-20 token via the MiniSwap MiniDapp that will be available soon.

The following pie chart demonstrates that only 9.8% of the Total Circulating Supply of Minima coins will be available on exchanges at TGE as $WMINIMA: 

![Minima](/img/token/circulatingSupplyTGELM.svg#gh-light-mode-only)![Minima](/img/token/circulatingSupplyTGEDM.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

## Token Generation Event (TGE)

100% of Native Minima (1,000,000,000 $MINIMA coins) will be minted at the Token Generation Event, and 12.5% of these coins will be wrapped on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens (125,000,000 $WMINIMA coins), in order for Wrapped Minima to be tradable on exchanges shortly after the event. 


Native Minima (875,000,000 $MINIMA coins) will be available to trade peer-2-peer via a MiniSwap MiniDapp and then on exchanges once the necessary middleware integration has been implemented, expected Q3/Q4 2023. 

| | Supply | Process | 
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
|**Total Minima** | 1,000,000,000 |Minted at Token Generation Event|
|**Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA)** | 125,000,000 |Wrapped on Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens |
|**Native Minima ($MINIMA)** | 875,000,000 |Native Minima for circulation |

## Allocation Categories 
### Public Sale

16% of Minima's total supply (160,000,000 coins) is allocated to the Public category, that includes both Public Presale and Treasury subcategories. 

#### Public Presale

Join the Waitlist for the Public Presale [here](https://presale.minima.global/)

6% of Minima's total supply (60,000,000 coins) is allocated to the Public Presale. 

The Public Presale will be for Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA). Enabling Minima to be tradable on exchanges shortly after the Token Generation Event, without waiting for technical integration of Native Minima ($MINIMA) onto exchanges, scheduled for Q3/Q4 2023.

The Public Presale will have four ‘tranches’ between 10:00 UTC 14th February 2023 and 22:00 UTC 28th February 2023, with a limited volume of coins in each tranche. 

Across all tranches the minimum investment size is USD $150, to enable as many people as possible to participate. Tranche 1 has a maximum investment size of USD $25,000, whereas tranches 2, 3 and 4 have a maximum investment size of USD $100,000. 

Earlier tranches benefit from a greater discount, as shown below:

| | Start | | |End |

|**Release schedule** |100% at launch|100% at launch|100% at launch|100% at launch|

#### Treasury 

10% of Minima's total supply (100,000,000 coins) is allocated to the Minima Foundation. 

The purpose of the foundation is to support, maintain and improve Minima, by providing services for the benefit of the project. With the aim to ensure the network remains completely decentralized over time. 

The foundation's main responsibilities include; the regulation and monitoring of token issuance, the management of intellectual property, public relations work, as well as the development of Minima’s public image. It will also oversee the funding of cutting-edge projects, to enable the ecosystem to thrive. 

#### Circulating Supply

The chart below shows how coins allocated for the Public Sale category will gradually be released into the total supply in time:

![Minima](/img/token/newpublicSaleCirculatingSupplyLM.svg#gh-light-mode-only)![Minima](/img/token/newpublicSaleCirculatingSupplyDM.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Node Incentives 

Up to 12% of Minima's total supply (120,000,000 coins) will be allocated to Node Incentives. 

Node Incentives were distributed via an Incentive Program that rewarded early community members for running a node, alongside an Invite Program, which rewarded members for inviting new members to join. 

Rewards earned by Incentive Program members will be distributed as Native Minima ($MINIMA). An additional 75 coins are available for Incentive Program members who continue to run their node 6 months after the TGE, and a further 75 coins are available at the 1-year anniversary of the TGE.  

The final Node Incentives coin allocation will be determined after the Proof of Person process is complete. Once known, any coins not utilised will be directed towards the Loyalty Program & Grants category, continuing to reward early adopters for bootstrapping the network, while ensuring a flourishing ecosystem is built. 

#### Circulating Supply

The chart below shows how coins allocated for the Node Incentives category will gradually be released into the total supply in time:

![Minima](/img/token/nodeIncentivesCirculatingSupplyLM.svg#gh-light-mode-only)![Minima](/img/token/nodeIncentivesCirculatingSupplyDM.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Loyalty Program & Grants 

23% of Minima's total supply (230,000,000 coins) is allocated to the Loyalty Program & Grants category, that includes both Loyalty Program and Grants subcategories. 

#### Loyalty Program

After the Token Generation Event, Minima will launch an innovative Loyalty Program that will be open to all. Unlike traditional farming schemes, Minima’s Loyalty Program will be a non-custodial, fully-collateralised yield product. 

The Loyalty Program will offer excellent rewards in the form of Native Minima ($MINIMA), paid to participants who lock up their holdings for set periods of time. Encouraging continued node running, and reducing the total circulating supply of Minima while creating genuine demand for coins. 

#### Grants 

Will be available to enable interesting and novel use cases to be built on Minima. They will be awarded to developers and entrepreneurs through a series of scheduled application rounds, in collaboration with a range of Minima partners, to accelerate the growth of the network. 

Grants will also be available for individuals who discover critical bugs and report them to the #support channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/minima), before anyone else. 

Subscribe to our announcement channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/minima) or [Telegram](https://t.me/MinimaGlobal) to be the first to know once the Loyalty Program and Grants become available.

### Private Allocations 

49% of Minima's total supply (490,000,000 coins) is allocated between the Team & Advisors, Private Seed, Seed, Private 1 and Private 2 categories. 

Earlier rounds were conducted when the technology was not yet built, or at a very early stage. The pricing of these rounds reflected the level of risk that early backers were prepared to take as early believers in Minima’s long-term vision. 

Rounds prior to the Public Presale sold at the following prices: 

|Round Name | Team & Advisors | Private Seed  | Seed  |Private 1   |Private 2 |
|:------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:------------------|

<!-- The total supply of Minima is fixed at 1 billion tokens and pre-allocated. As there are no dedicated miners, there is no method for distributing coins after Mainnet launch.
This is one of the unique features of our cooperative PoW chain. Our distribution strategy reflects the importance to rapidly gain security based on a minimum target of 1 million active and participating Mainnet nodes.

The majority of public allocation will be made available through our series of community incentive initiatives and a grant program.
Our ecosystem benefits from the stability and trust that comes with the reassurance that there are no risks around hard-forking, opinion battles or financially motivated strategies, all of which together offer the ultimate footing for scaling rapidly. Minima is a positively interdependent network, where Users cooperate in a win-win scenario. What is good for one user is good for another, and more users means more decentralization, and more security.

Users of Minima can rely on Layer 1 performance and security guarantees of a well formed, available, equally represented and fully decentralized, censorship and quantum resistant system.

## Public Allocation

51% of the Minima token supply is reserved for public circulation. 

## Public Sale


16% is reserved for public sale and will be made available through a series of timed sale events.

5% of the public sale allocation will be released pre-TGE, up to 5% at the TGE, with the remaining 6% available for release from the 1st Anniversary. 

The focus and dedication to building a strong and diverse community and ecosystem will ensure long standing utility value for the Minima token and drive consistent organic liquidity growth.

## Community Allocations 

The remaining 35% of public allocation is reserved for community circulation through our incentive channels. 

In the event that we experience greater than expected organic growth resulting in us reaching our target minimum node runner goal with allocations in-hand, any remaining tokens will be added to and distributed through our public sale channels. 

We are running a range of incentive initiatives for our community. Our approach is multi-facetted aimed at reaching our goal of a secure, decentralized, censorship resistant protocol, and an active, engaged ecosystem. 

## Incentive Program 

30% of the total supply is being dedicated to growing an active and thriving community.  

Through a range of channels, we are encouraging a growing community of users and developers to battle test the Minima protocol and build a marketplace of innovative MiniDapps.  Community members can earn token rewards for running nodes, ﬁnding bugs and developing on the Minima blockchain. 

This single largest allocation of coins will be used to reach our target of 1 million active nodes at Mainnet launch.  

## Grant Program 

A grant fund, equal to 5% of the total supply, has been established to enable interesting and novel uses of Minima. 

Grants are awarded for developments based on merit and their potential to increase Minima adoption, lower barriers to entry (across both crypto and non-crypto groups) and grow the network, both in scale and geographically. 

Grants will be awarded through a series of scheduled application rounds and in collaboration with a range of Minima partners, aligned to, and after, the Mainnet launch to garner further momentum up to, and throughout the early stages of growth. 

## Release Schedule

Pre-sale allocations are unlocked over time ensuring deterministic liquidity in line with our post-launch growth trajectory. With no miners to pay, complete certainty of the total number of coins in the system can be achieved at a far greater rate, allowing for economic equilibrium to play out much faster. In this way, supply and demand are balanced in the absence of external influences. 

| Allocation | Release Schedule |
|:------------|:------------------|
|**Team & Advisors** | Linear vesting over 3 years, starting 3 months after TGE |
|**Seed - Institutional** | 33% at TGE, then 67% at 1 year after TGE |
|**Seed - Friends & Family** | 25% at TGE, then 5% monthly after TGE |
|**Private 1** | 40% at TGE, then 5% monthly after TGE |
|**Private 2** | 50% at TGE, then 5% monthly after TGE | -->
