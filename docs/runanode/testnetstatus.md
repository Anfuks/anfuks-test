# Latest Testnet Status

*Last updated: 6th January 2023*

As we get closer to mainnet, there is important information you need to know.

Incentive Program users will need to take action to ensure you receive your accrued Rewards at mainnet.

Roadmap of events prior to coin distribution:

![Community Roadmap](/img/runanode/Community_Roadmap_Graphic_v4.png)

## What you need to know about… 

### ...your node
Most importantly, you must be running **version 103.28 or above before the 31st January.** If you are not on this version or above, you may not be able to collect your coins at mainnet. 

If you have installed Minima from the Google Play store, you can set your app to update automatically from the Play Store settings.

:::info Checking your version
To check the version of Minima you are running, check the status of your node.

For help , select your platform of choice from [Get Started](/docs/runanode/get_started) and see the section "How to check the Status of your node".
:::

:::important Seed Phrase and Backups
After mainnet, you will need to know your 24 word seed phrase and take frequent backups to ensure your funds remain safe. 
Your seed phrase can be found from the **Backup/Restore** page (click on **Archive**) on Android, or using the `Vault` command from the Terminal MiniDapp. 
:::

### ...the Incentive Program
The Incentive Rewards Program is now **closed to new users.**

Existing users will continue to earn 1 Reward a day, however you will **no longer see pings after 31st December** being updated on your node.

All Rewards due for 2023 will be sent to your Incentive Program account in one go (instead of daily) prior to the coin distribution, provided you continue to run your node.

After mainnet, you will **no longer have an Incentive Program account** and will not be able to login to the Incentive Program website to view your Rewards. 

Rewards will be converted to real Minima and they will be sent to your Minima wallet address, so make sure you can access your MiniDapp System before mainnet! 

### ...receiving your Rewards
At the point of coin distribution, all of your Rewards will be converted to real Minima and sent to your Minima wallet address.

:::tip
Make sure you have the Wallet MiniDapp installed so you can easily see when you have received your real Minima! 
:::

Ensure the node you have connected your Incentive ID to is the one you want to receive your Rewards to.

You should have only one node running with your Incentive ID connected to it. If you have been running multiple nodes, decide which node you wish to receive your coins to and connect your ID to that node.

Attempting to connect the same Incentive ID to multiple nodes may cause you confusion when receiving your coins! 

:::info proof of person
A Know Your Customer (KYC) process will not be required to collect your $MINIMA Rewards, however you will be required to complete our ‘Proof of Person’ process so we can verify that you are not a bot!

**Keep an eye on your inbox for this verification request.**

If you have trouble completing the proof of person verification or no longer have access to your email, you will be able to go through manual verification in our #support channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/minima) when it opens.
