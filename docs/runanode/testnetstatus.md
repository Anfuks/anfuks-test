# Latest Testnet Status

*Last updated: 21st January 2023*

As we get closer to Mainnet, here is the important information you need to know.

Incentive Program members will need to take action to ensure you receive your accrued Rewards at Mainnet.

Roadmap of events prior to coin distribution:

![Community Roadmap](/img/runanode/Community_Roadmap_Graphic_v4.png)

## What you need to know about… 

### ...your node
Most importantly, you must be running **version 103.28 or above before the 31st January.** If you are not on this version or above, you may not be able to collect your coins at Mainnet. 

If you have installed Minima from the Google Play store, you can set your app to update automatically from the Play Store settings.

:::info Checking your version
To check the version of Minima you are running, check the status of your node.

For help , select your platform of choice from [Get Started](/docs/runanode/get_started) and see the section "How to check the Status of your node".
:::

:::important Seed Phrase and Backups
After Mainnet, you will need to know your 24 word seed phrase and take frequent backups to ensure your funds remain safe. 
Your seed phrase can be found from the **Backup/Restore** page (click on **Archive Node**) on Android, or using the `Vault` command from the Terminal MiniDapp. 
:::

### ...the Incentive Program
The Incentive Rewards Program is now **closed to new members.**

Existing members will continue to earn 1 Reward a day, however, you will **no longer see pings after 31st December** being updated on your node.

All Rewards due for 2023 will be sent to your Incentive Program account in one go (instead of daily) prior to the coin distribution, provided you continue to run your node.

After Mainnet, you will **no longer have an Incentive Program account** and will not be able to login to the Incentive Program website to view your Rewards. 

Rewards will be converted to real Minima and they will be sent to your Minima wallet address, so make sure you can access your MiniDapp System before Mainnet! 

### ...receiving your Rewards
At the point of coin distribution, all of your Rewards will be converted to real Minima and sent to your Minima wallet address.

:::tip
Make sure you have the Wallet MiniDapp installed so you can easily see when you have received your real Minima! 
:::

Ensure the node you have your Incentive ID connected to is the one you want to receive your Rewards to.

You should have only one node running with your Incentive ID connected to it. If you have been running multiple nodes, decide which node you wish to receive your coins to and connect your ID to that node.

Attempting to connect the same Incentive ID to multiple nodes may cause confusion when receiving your coins! 

:::info proof of person
Know Your Customer (KYC) will not be required to collect your Minima Rewards, however, you will be required to complete our ‘Proof of Person’ process so we can verify that you are not a bot!
:::

### ...Incentive Reward Account Verification

Minima operates a “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy. This means that a real human must exist behind each Incentive Reward Account.

In order to ensure that your account is genuine and not the product of bot activity, we require each Incentive Reward Account holder to pass our simple Verify process.

#### What is the Verify process?

Our Verify process consists of two phases:

**Phase 1**

Our team will review the Incentive Reward database algorithmically and manually to identify accounts that are either <br/>
a) clearly the result of bot activity or <br/> b) part of a network of accounts.

Accounts that fail Phase 1 will not be notified.

**Phase 2**

All accounts that pass Phase 1 will be invited via the email address on your Incentive Reward Account to complete Phase 2.

Phase 2 started on the 13th January.

This email contains a unique link for you to click that will identify your account to us. You will then be asked to complete a form that will provide us with the verification we need to satisfy our “One Incentivized Node Per Human” policy.

Please take note that your link is single-use, so **please do not click it until you are ready to proceed with verification.**

If you have successfully verified, you will receive email confirmation within 24 hours. 

Once you have your confirmation, you are guaranteed to receive your rewards at Token Distribution, pending collection of your Wallet details at a later date.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I have lost access to my Incentive Reward Account email address

A process to contact us will be made available week of the 23rd January. In the meantime, DO NOT open a Support Ticket. We will be unable to help you.

#### I didn’t receive an invite to Verify

Please first check your spam inbox. 

If you haven’t had an email by Monday 16th January, this will be for one of 2 reasons. You either failed Phase 1, or there was an issue with the email address we hold on record for you. 

Complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoSwdl6o_hsZQR6BE_iiOmocEGaC4jCnHUGpXfnGAYb_zy2A/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you did not receive the email.

DO NOT open a Support Ticket. We will be unable to help you.

If successful, you will get a Verify email, or one of the team will reach out to you on Discord.

If you do not hear from us within 5 working days of submission, your account has not passed Verify. All decisions are final.

#### It has been 24 hours since completing Verify, but I have not received a confirmation email

You have failed Verification. If you believe this to be in error, you can contact us using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-khUVayeVDB8zbXVmm5w82CPxeiqD_Xn3OcnIyHdnjwAl2g/viewform?usp=sf_link).

One of the team can look into why you failed and you might be contacted via a support ticket on Discord, however there is no guarantee of verification. Any decision made is final.

### ...the Mainnet Bootstrap phase 

Over the next 4-6 weeks, we will be starting the controlled rollout of Minima Mainnet (version 1.0.6) as we begin the Bootstrap phase

The Bootstrap phase involves steadily increasing the users on the main network.

There is no benefit, reward or incentive for joining the network at this early stage, so don’t worry if you are not updated yet!

Mainnet v1.0.6 is now available for:
1. Manual node runners on desktop (using the .jar from Github)
2. Users still running the old installation script on a VPS

What you need to know:
- There will be no transactions on the network yet
- Users running v0.103 may start to experience disruption 
- Gimme20 will NOT work on this version

What you need to do:
- Ensure your node is secured! For example, if you are running Minima on a server your RPC port must be closed (default port 9005)
- Take note of your NEW seed phrase which can be found using the `vault` command
- Regularly check the `status` of your node to ensure your tip block is up to date

Mainnet versions for Docker and Android will be made available in the coming weeks.
