# Get Started

Running a Minima node couldn't be easier; to start your node, select your platform of choice:

- [Android](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/android_v9_and_up)<br/>
*In a rush? Download Minima from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minima.android&hl=en&gl=US)!*

- Linux Server (VPS): choose [Docker](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/linux_vps) or a [Script](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/linuxvpsservice) setup

- [Windows](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/windows)

- [Mac](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/mac)

- [Linux Desktop](/docs/runanode/selectplatform/linux_desktop)

- iPhone (due 2023)

:::important First time users

To achieve Minima's vision of complete decentralisation, there are now no centralised servers that control access to the network. 

When running a node for the first time, you now need to upload a list of peers provided by an active node runner. 

This will enable you to download the blockchain and join the network. 

Select your platform of choice to learn how.

Once your node running, [learn about MiniDapps](/docs/learn/minidapps/minidappsintro) to discover your open, decentralised ecosystem.
