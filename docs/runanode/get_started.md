:::info THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS NOW CLOSED
The Incentive Rewards Program is now closed to new users.

Existing users will continue to earn, however all Rewards due for 2023 will be received in March (prior to Token distribution) instead of daily.

From Mainnet version 1.0 and above, you do not need to have your Incentive ID connected to your node.
