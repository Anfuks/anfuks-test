# Incentive Program Setup

All existing Incentive Program users must pass the Proof of Person verification process to collect your Rewards at Mainnet. 

From Mainnet version 1.0 and above, you do not need to have your Incentive ID connected to your node.
 
As long as you pass the Verify process, you will be able to claim your Total Rewards balance to a Mainnet node of your choice (including Rewards for Jan 1st until TGE) once the Payout process begins.
 
In order to be ready for your Reward collection, we advise running the Mainnet version as early as you can to get familiar with your node and to test the latest security features - we will soon have some workshops to explain how best to secure your Mainnet node prior to you receiving your coins.
 
Please refer to the [Testnet Status](https://docs.minima.global/docs/runanode/testnetstatus/) page for the latest information. 


<!-- After [installing Minima](/docs/runanode/get_started), if you are an existing user of the Incentive Program you must connect your Incentive ID to your node to start receiving daily Rewards.

:::info THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS NOW CLOSED
The Incentive Rewards Program is now closed to new users.

Existing users will continue to earn, however all Rewards due for 2023 will be received in March (prior to Token distribution) instead of daily, provided you continue to run your node.
