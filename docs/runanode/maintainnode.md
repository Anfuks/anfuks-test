# Maintain your node

From time to time you should check on the status of your node to ensure it continues to run smoothly.

## Checking node health

From the Home screen, you can check your top block number in the top right corner, if there is a warning symbol, this may indicate that your node requires attention as it may not be in sync with the latest block.

From the **Health** MiniDapp, you can check:

1. the version number of Minima running
2. the latest block number and time
3. the full status of the node

## Checking the logs 

The Logs MiniDapp will give you an indication of the most recent processes, connections and activities occurring on your node.
