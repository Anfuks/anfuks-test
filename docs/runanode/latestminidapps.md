A brief description of each MiniDapp is below.

## 1. News Feed

## 2. The Wallet 
The Wallet is where you can manage all the funds you own on the Minima blockchain.<br/>

## 3. Block Explorer
The Block Explorer lets you view the latest blocks and transactions on the Minima blockchain.

**Using the Block Explorer MiniDapp, you can:**
- Navigate through the Minima blockchain
- Search by address or TxPoW ID - due to the pruning of the chain, only the last 1000 blocks will be visible
- Select a block to view its details and the transactions in it

Each block in the chain consists of a main transaction and a transaction list. 

When you select a block, you will see 3 tabs, Details, Inputs and Outputs. 
- **Details:** shows the block details, including its transaction list at the bottom.
- **Inputs:** shows details for the coins used as inputs to the block’s main transaction (if one exists). 
- **Outputs:** shows the corresponding Outputs of the main transaction (if one exists).
