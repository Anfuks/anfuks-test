  "description": "Blocks in Minima are small. As small as a transaction. All transactions are potential blocks. Blocks are just lucky transactions. Blocks only contain references to transactions (Compact blocks in Bitcoin), that have already been sent across the network, rather than the entire transaction. Minima also uses an adaptive block size. The maximum size is set by the chain as twice the average block size of the last n blocks. This allows the users themselves to determine the block size. By filling their blocks higher than the average they will make the maximum size greater, by filling them lower, the maximum will be made lower. Users can drag the maximum block size up or down depending on whether they need it, or whether enough traffic is going Lightning[3] and beyond.",
