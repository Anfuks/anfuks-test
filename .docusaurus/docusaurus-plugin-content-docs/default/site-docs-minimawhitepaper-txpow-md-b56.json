  "description": "Removing the miners requires the users themselves to secure the chain. User-based PoW security has been tried before. The DAG[3] style IOTA[8] allows users to perform a small amount of PoW work before they can send their transaction. Unlike Minima, IOTA does not use a blockchain, instead, opting for a transaction DAG or Tangle. Whether the Tangle can converge in a decentralized fashion is still a topic of debate and recently IOTA switched to a new system, in an attempt to rectify their current solution, a centralized checkpoint server.",
