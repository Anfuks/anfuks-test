  "description": "Adam Backs’ HashCash[9] was the first weaponized version of PoW. A Denial-of-Service (DoS) counter-measure first deployed to prevent email spam. Sending millions of emails ‘costs’ nothing – hardware, processing, bandwidth, etc. A lone computer sitting on the internet can send millions of emails in almost no time, constantly. HashCash enforced that a PoW payment was included whenever an email was sent. To a single user sending emails every few minutes, this was utterly negligible, a background process that hummed for a few seconds after you press the ‘Send’ button. But to the spam-machine sitting on the internet trying to send millions of emails, this would require millions of seconds of work, an impossible task.",
