  "description": "In decentralized blockchain systems all full users need to agree on the rules. If there is no agreement on the rules there can be no consensus on the ordering and eventual outcome of actions. Current blockchain systems have 2 types of consensus changes available. This is because there are 2 types of ‘full’ user. The first helps in the construction and validation of the chain - Complete nodes (the miners). The second only helps in the validation of the chain - Full nodes (the validators). We ignore Wallet users, by far the largest group on these chains (unlike Minima), who neither validate nor construct, and are simply swept along, whether they agree or not.",
