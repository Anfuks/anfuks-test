  "description": "Both Minima and Maxima require users to perform a small amount of PoW when sending messages. The more messages, the more PoW. The more PoW, the more secure the network. But what if a user is not sending any messages? Can that user also help to secure the network? What if sending a message is time-critical, and there must be no delay before sending it â€“ say a high-frequency trader? Maxima addresses both these concerns by repurposing existing technology, allowing users to do the work beforehand, and then present that work as proof when sending messages.",
