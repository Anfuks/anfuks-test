  "description": "The security of a transaction is not improved by a faster block speed, since the amount of security is a function of the cumulative PoW of the parent blocks (hash-rates being equal 1 BTC block is worth 4 LTC blocks, since LTC runs 4x faster). A faster chain does increase the granularity of information[6] and allows a user to know sooner when their transaction is secure enough. The longer you wait, the more secure.",
